### About the EPoCH study

EPoCH is an epidemiological study that takes a systematic approach to explore associations between prenatal parental health behaviours and multiple child health outcomes.

The study combines data from four longitudinal cohort studies (ALSPAC, BiB, MoBa, and MCS), with a combined maximum sample size of [**`r max(dat$total_n,na.rm=T)`**]{.underline}. Regression analyses were performed within each cohort, and then, where possible, results were meta-analysed to produce average effect estimates across the cohorts.

EPoCH generated results from [**`r nrow(dat)`**]{.underline} models, exploring associations between [**`r length(unique(dat$exposure_linker[-which(dat$exposure_class == "socioeconomic position"|dat$person_exposed=="partner")]))`**]{.underline} variables describing parental health behaviours (reflecting different types and timings of exposure to parental **smoking**, **alcohol** consumption, **caffeine** consumption), and [**`r length(unique(dat$outcome_linker))`**]{.underline} child health outcomes (reflecting different traits relating to **body size and composition**, **psychosocial** and **cognitive** factors, **immunology**, **blood pressure**, and serum **biomarkers**, measured at several ages). Where possible, health behaviours from both parents are studied. Associations between parental **socioeconomic position** and child health outcomes are also presented for comparison.

### What can I do with EPoCH Explorer?

EPoCH explorer is a web app providing interactive and customisable data visualisations, interpretations, and downloads to disseminate results from the EPoCH study. It is a useful tool for research and it can also serve as an aid for teaching about causal inference and triangulation of evidence garnered from observational data.

Click the tabs in the navigation bars above to explore EPoCH results.

![](www/volcano-solid.svg){width="23" height="23"} **Volcano plots:** visualise results by both precision (P value) and magnitude of association (effect estimate), while comparing results for each parent side by side.

![](www/chart-gantt-solid.svg){width="23" height="23"} **Coefficient plots:** compare effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals across up to four different exposure/model combinations, for different sets of outcomes.

![](www/otter-solid.svg){width="23" height="23"} **Deep dive:** narrow in on a specific exposure/outcome/model combination to find out more about the data used to derive the result, its interpretation, and to see how the result from each cohort compares to the meta-analysed summary in a forest plot.
